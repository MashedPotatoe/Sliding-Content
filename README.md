# Sliding Content
This is a little thing that I made in my past time. What it does simply is to display content via. the act of sliding.

## Using it

#### Dependencies

You can use the jQuery plugin in order to use it. So first, you'll have to add all the dependencies and JS and CSS files:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../dependencies/waves.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../sliding-content.css">

<script type="text/javascript" src="../dependencies/jquery-2.1.4.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../dependencies/waves.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../sliding-content.js"></script>
```

Of course, you'll have to instatiate the sliding-content, but first, we'll have to work on the HTML structure first.
